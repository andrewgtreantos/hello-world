# hello-world
testing out and learning about GitHub

I have struggled in more Network Marketing companies than I care to remember…
It started in Amway. I remember sitting across the table, watching this well dressed man drawing circles and dollar signs as I imagined a better life for me and my family and friends!
"You get 5, who get their 5, who get their 5 and before you know it, everybody's rich!".
Of course, for me it didn’t work out that way. 
Over the years, I tried again and again, 
from desktop computers, to vitamins, 
to energy drinks, etc.
Then came the internet, and “Attraction Marketing,” and info products. 
I believed this was my ticket, because now I could market my products without chasing down friends and family.
It sounded way cooler!
But I struggled... and struggled... and struggled!
I gave up several times. 
I discovered entrepreneurship isn't for the faint of heart.
I had wild expectations!
But something was holding me back. 
Maybe... my belief wasn’t big enough.
Maybe... I didn’t think I deserved it. 
Maybe... I didn’t think I was good enough.
Starting an online business is a serious wake up call.
Becoming a successful entrepreneur requires holding up a mirror to all the limiting beliefs I was holding onto.
The game of online marketing requires much more courage and boldness than I ever imagined.
I made the decision here and now to change!
I am climbing over my problems rather than to dwelling on them.
I am changing my stinking thinkin. 
It's not easy, and I will have setbacks. But I an forging ahead!
I am focusing my energy and creating something great!
Today, after years of struggle… 
... after beating myself up...
… I simply won't live any other way... 
… I am going to live and prosper…
… I want the freedom lifestyle of an entrepreneur...
It's my birthright.
It's what I think about daily.
I'm committed to being all in...
… so that my family and friends and I can enjoy a freedom lifestyle.
Wake up! 
Do you want a freedom lifestyle? 
Are you committed to your success?
Give it your all! Starting right now...
- Find a business vehicle that really works!
- Take Massive Action... Daily!
- Learn from your mistakes!
- Become the entrepreneur you were destined to be!

If this sounds crazy... or doesn't inspire you, or scares the hell out of you...
then maybe you're not ready.
And that's totally fine.
I wasn't ready either...
I totally understand...
It's not for everybody. 
It's not for the faint of heart.
We can still be friends.
However, if you really want it... and you're not sure where to start or who to trust...
Message me... "I'm ready to get started!"
